<h1 id="easter-sunday">Easter Sunday</h1>

<p><img src="/img/cyprus-337480_1920.jpg" alt="Empty Tomb in Cyprus" /></p>

<p>Jesus. The center of our faith. Without Him, everything is useless. He is the Creator, and he is the Savior. He is, as we have talked about in our Wednesday nights and as I mentioned in communion last week, all knowing. And we all know that. From the beginning of the creation of the world, God knew that atonement would be needed and He had a plan all along. So, as we come to this Sunday, one in which we celebrate the resurrection of Christ, I want to look at how the plan was there all along.</p>

<p>Firstly though, let us see why it is that we need a sacrifice by looking at two verses. First, we have to acknowledge that we are sinful. I think we can all admit that here today. I love the way Isaiah puts it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Isaiah 59:2</strong>
But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our sins have separated us. We cannot remove that barrier ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 5:21</strong>
God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (NIV)</p>

<p><strong>Luke 18:18–27</strong></p>

<p><em>The Rich Ruler</em></p>

<p>[18] And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” [19] And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [20] You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’” [21] And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.” [22] When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” [23] But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. [24] Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! [25] For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” [26] Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” <strong>[27] But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</strong> (ESV) (Emphasis my own.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we cannot save ourselves, we need atonement. Atonement cannot be made without a perfect sacrifice. Thankfully, there was a plan.</p>

<h2 id="sacrificial-lamb">Sacrificial Lamb</h2>

<p><img src="/img/sheep-2672665.png" alt="Slain Lamb" /></p>

<p>Animals are used as sacrifices throughout the Old Testament. In Leviticus we can read about sacrifices for everything. How to do it, what animal, why to do it, etc. etc. on and on.</p>

<p>Hebrews 10 shows us but why we offered sacrifices, as well as how Christ fits into this sacrificial system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hebrews 10:1–4</strong></p>

<p><em>Christ&rsquo;s Sacrifice Once for All</em></p>

<p>[1] For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. [2] Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? [3] But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. [4] For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skipping ahead a bit,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hebrews 10:8–18</strong></p>

<p>[8] When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), [9] then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. [10] And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<p>[11] And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. [12] But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, [13] waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. [14] For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>

<p>[15] And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>[16] “This is the covenant that I will make with them
    after those days, declares the Lord:
I will put my laws on their hearts,
    and write them on their minds,”


[17] then he adds,

“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”


[18] Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin. (ESV)
</code></pre>

<p>What a powerful message. Where there is <em>forgiveness</em> of these, there is no longer any offering for sin. Forgiveness. Not just a covering, but forgiveness.</p>

<p>So we know that the plan was for <em>the Christ</em> to come and to offer sacrifice of Himself, the sacrificial lamb. You can see why there would have been excitement over this. John the Baptist says &ndash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 1:29</strong></p>

<p><em>Behold, the Lamb of God</em></p>

<p>[29] The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. I like this description, it reminds me of another set of verses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 5:1–10</strong></p>

<p><em>The Scroll and the Lamb</em></p>

<p>[1] Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. [2] And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” [3] And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, [4] and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. [5] And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p>

<p>[6] And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. [7] And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. [8] And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. [9] And they sang a new song, saying,</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>“Worthy are you to take the scroll
    and to open its seals,
for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God
    from every tribe and language and people and nation,
[10] and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
    and they shall reign on the earth.” (ESV)
</code></pre>

<p>This picture really hits me. This is the embodiment of the Gospels. There was no one would could save us &ndash; and then the Lamb (Jesus) comes. John wept because there was no one to save us. Then, the Lamb comes and there is no reason for tears anymore because He is worthy to open the scroll. He is worthy because He has conquered death. He is our sacrificial lamb.</p>

<h2 id="jesus-death-foretold">Jesus&rsquo; Death, Foretold</h2>

<p><img src="/img/art-2092530_1920.jpg" alt="Crosses on a hill" />
So we know now that we needed a sacrificial lamb, but how do we know that this was part of a plan and not just something Jesus decided to do while He was with us? Well, we have prophecy. Let&rsquo;s look at some of these Old Testament prophecies and think if we can find where they connect with Jesus.</p>

<h3 id="ot-prophecy">OT Prophecy</h3>

<p>Is 53:8-9(Luke 23:39-41, Luke 23:46-47, John 19:38-39)</p>

<p>Psalm 16:10 (Acts 2:24 &amp; Acts 13:33-35)</p>

<p>Psalm 22:1(Mark 15:34)</p>

<p>Psalm 22:7-8(Mark 15:29-32)</p>

<p>Psalm 22:16b-18(John 19:36)</p>

<p>The death of Jesus is not only foretold in the Old Testament, it is also found in the Gospels, stated by Jesus Himself. If this was simply a man looking for fame or glory, I think I would have found a way out of this one, personally. So let&rsquo;s look at a few of these predictions that Jesus makes.</p>

<h3 id="jesus-prophecy">Jesus&rsquo; Prophecy</h3>

<p>John 10:18</p>

<p>Matt 12:40</p>

<p>Matt 20:18-19</p>

<p>Mark 8:31-33</p>

<p>This was something that was part of the plan. It had to happen. Jesus was very stern with Peter when Peter rebuked Jesus for saying that these things had to happen. From the beginning of time, Jesus had a plan and a way to save mankind from itself. Nothing was going to get in His way.</p>

<h2 id="passover">Passover</h2>

<p>Leading up to His crucifixion, we see that Jesus takes part in the Passover. The Passover, or the Feast of Weeks was a time when they celebrated the angel of Death passing over the doors to the people of Israel when the first born children of Egypt were killed. This Passover meal is recorded in all of the Gospels, <em>and</em> even by Paul, even though he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>In 1 Cor 5:7, while speaking of immorality in the Church, Paul encourages the people of Corinth to remember and celebrate the Passover, but in a new way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 5:7–8</strong></p>

<p>[7] Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. [8] Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think this is a commandment really about us needing to celebrate Passover, but more of an example to drive home his point, I think it shows that this was something special, that was part of the plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:23–26</strong></p>

<p>[23] For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, [24] and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [25] In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” [26] For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until he comes. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was part of the plan. Before Jesus takes this meal, we see that he sent the disciples ahead and that the place where they would eat this meal was already prepared for them in an upper room. This was also the case with the donkey that Jesus rode into the city. It was all prepared for Him, it was part of the plan.</p>

<p>So in honor of Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross we remember this plan. We remember His body that was broken, we remember His blood that was shed. We remember that He died as our sacrificial lamb, because nothing else was good enough. We remember Him. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to think about this Passover meal that was planned ahead of time and that we use in our communion time to remember our Lord who died on the cross for our sins.</p>

<h2 id="salvation-because-of-the-death-resurrection">Salvation Because of the Death &amp; Resurrection</h2>

<p><img src="/img/passion-3111247_1920.jpg" alt="Cross and Tomb" /></p>

<p>The next part of the plan was His death. There are many Scriptures that speak of Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross. We see His death talked about the Old Testament and we see it proclaimed by Jesus Himself. We know that this was necessary because he was the Lamb of God, the perfect sacrifice that we couldn&rsquo;t offer on our own behalf. We know that Jesus wants us to remember Him by celebrating the Passover during our time of Communion when we remember His body and blood. However, none of this would matter without the thing that we celebrate on Easter Sunday. Which is? &ndash; His resurrection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Peter 1:18–21</strong></p>

<p>[18] knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, [19] but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. [20] He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you [21] who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. (ESV)</p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:17–19</strong></p>

<p>[17] And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. [18] Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. [19] If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Christ has not been raised from the dead then our faith is &ldquo;futile&rdquo;. Whenever I hear that word I think of the Borg on Star Trek, &ldquo;resistance is futile&rdquo;. Anyway, futile means (according to m-w.com) <em>serving no useful purpose : completely ineffective</em>. Some synonyms are fruitless, ineffective, ineffectual, inefficacious, profitless, unavailing, unproductive, unprofitable, unsuccessful, and useless.</p>

<p>Our faith is not just founded on a man who died, but on a God who came to Earth as a man and who died and <strong>rose again!</strong>.</p>

<p>Jesus Himself tells us why He needed to raise from the dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 5:24</strong></p>

<p>[24] Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is only through resurrection that we can escape judgment. It is because Jesus <em>conquered</em> death and the judgment that we all deserved that we can pass into life with God eternally. Death is eternal condemnation, but life after death is freedom. Without raising from the dead, then Jesus would be eternally under judgment, but because He was raised, he passes into life and because He has done this, we can too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 John 5:11–12</strong></p>

<p>[11] And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. [12] Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a plan from the beginning. It was prophesied through the Old Testament and from Jesus Himself. We were told to remember His plan to die on the cross through the Passover meal, it was part of the plan and Jesus would die and raise again because without that essential aspect of the plan, we would still be bound in our sin. But there was a plan and Jesus, the perfect Lamb of God, executed this plan perfectly. He died, but then He rose again and because of that we can have life in Him.</p>
