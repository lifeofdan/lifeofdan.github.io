      <description>Lately, I feel that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been hanging onto it very well.
 Ephesians 5:16
[16] making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. (ESV)
 I was asked today what this meant. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of thinking it through on the spot even though this is a topic that I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at and talked about with my Dad recently. He even used it for a sermon sometime last year.</description>

      <description>So, this is a post about some of my favorite things at the moment. There is no real point to the post. I just have things that make me happy and I want to share those things with&amp;hellip;no one. Cause no one reads this blog. Or at least I assume no one does. If anyone does, feel free to contact me and say hello. :)
Visual Studio Code So, firstly.</description>

Well, it has been one day since I finished the installation of Hugo as my blogging back-end. Wow. It was a bit of a mess. I need to first say that now that everything is up and running, I really like it. Once set up, it makes a lot of sense in the way they have chosen to do things. However, it was a bear to get my head around the setup.</description>

      <description>This is my first post using Hugo. I heard about it while watching &amp;ldquo;Linux Thursday&amp;rdquo; which is one of the shows on The Lunduke Show. They said it was faster and simpler than Jekyll, which is what I have been using. I had just spend most of the day yesterday setting up my Jekyll site and while I like Jekyll I am wondering if there is something a bit more streamlined.</description>

      <description>So, yesterday I attended a professional development course. For anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, if you are a teacher in Queensland Australia you are required to attend at least 20 hours of professional development courses. This really isn&amp;rsquo;t that much and is easily achievable. Especially since most schools run some kind of professional development internally. (I&amp;rsquo;m going to call professional development &amp;ldquo;CPD&amp;rdquo; because it stands for &amp;ldquo;continuing professional development&amp;rdquo; from now on to shorten things.</description>

      <description>It is that time again. I quite liked the old layout of the site. However, I had installed jekyll (the backend of this site) on a different computer and couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to update the thing and it was many versions behind. So, I reinstalled jekyll to my main rig, deleted the old repo and then loaded fresh. (I am a nuke and pave kind of a guy&amp;hellip;I admit it.</description>

      <description>Hard times.
We all have them. Some hard times are more genuine than others. Dropping your ice-cream cone, while detrimental when you are two years old, is really not as serious as loss of a job, or loss of a loved one, or loss of personal health or safety.</description>

Okay, so my last post was a bit frustrated. I continue to exist in that state of being. :P
This Christmas I built a new computer. Nothing super fancy, but a very nice upgrade for me from a i5 2500k to now running a e3 1230 v5 Xeon processor. I am also running an AMD R9 Fury graphics card. The rationale for the new graphics card and CPU was to run a Windows VM for my gaming with GPU Passthrough.</description>

      <description>It has been a month since my last post. I seem to be churning out one of these a month, and that is okay with me. I normally stop doing this after a couple of days. I really like being able to keep track of the work I am doing and being able to access it remotely from a variety of devices. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this site something that has ways to comment or anything like that.</description>

      <description>A second post? Whaaaaat! I cannot believe I am about to write the second post on a site that I have created. I really enjoy the process of creating the site and making it work. I generally don&amp;rsquo;t care about actually using it. But, this seems kind of special to me.
I have been working more and more with git. I really like it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used the more advanced functions that it offers, but I believe I am learning the basics.</description>

      <description>Well, I am finally putting up a site that I believe I will maintain. I have put up many sites throughout the years, but they always fall into disarray. This time I actually need this site. I need it to work so that I can work.
I am super excited, and if you are reading this&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t you have anything better to do?</description>
