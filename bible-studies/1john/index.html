<p>Love one another, practice righteousness. You will not fit in with the world, so live as Christ and await His coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 24 Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
<strong>1 John 3:23 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="verses-11-18">Verses 11-18</h3>

<h4 id="q1-what-is-the-message-that-we-have-heard-from-the-beginning">Q1. What is the message that we have heard from the beginning?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> That we should love one another.</p>

<h4 id="q2-why-did-cain-murder-his-brother">Q2. Why did Cain murder his brother?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&rsquo;s were righteous.</p>

<h4 id="q3-why-were-cain-s-deeds-evil-hot">Q3. Why were Cain&rsquo;s deeds evil? <code>HOT</code></h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We aren&rsquo;t really sure. This is something that has piqued my curiosity since I was a very small child. Why did God not regard Cain&rsquo;s offering well, while praising the offering of Abel? It could be that his sacrifice was not pleasing because it was not the best of his crops, whereas Abel&rsquo;s were the best of his herd. Or it could be that God required a blood sacrifice and Abel obeyed this, while Cain did not. Or it could be the spirit in which they offered the sacrifice. The truth is, we don&rsquo;t know for certain. The only thing we know with absolute certainty is that <em>Cain&rsquo;s deeds were evil, while his brother&rsquo;s were righteous and because of that Cain murdered his brother</em>.</p>

<h4 id="q4-should-we-be-surprised-that-the-world-hates-us">Q4. Should we be surprised that the world hates us?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.</p>

<h4 id="q5-have-you-ever-personally-felt-that-the-world-hates-you-hot">Q5. Have you ever personally felt that the world hates you? <code>HOT</code></h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers will vary.</p>

<h4 id="q6-what-would-you-say-to-someone-who-says-that-they-are-a-christian-but-they-don-t-go-to-church-because-they-do-not-like-the-people-that-go-there-hot">Q6. What would you say to someone who says that they are a Christian, but they don&rsquo;t go to church because they do not like the people that go there? <code>HOT</code></h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Whoever does not love abides in death.</p>

<h4 id="q7-what-ought-we-be-willing-to-do-for-our-brothers-and-sisters-if-we-love-them">Q7. What ought we be willing to do for our brothers and sisters if we love them?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We ought to be willing to lay down our lives for them. We ought to be willing to give of our possessions.</p>

<h4 id="q8-can-god-s-love-live-in-us-if-we-do-not-give-to-our-brothers-and-sisters-in-need">Q8. Can God&rsquo;s love live in us if we do not give to our brothers and sisters in need?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.</p>

<h4 id="q9-does-this-mean-we-need-to-give-everything-that-we-have-until-we-can-no-longer-live-to-sustain-ourselves-or-our-family-hot">Q9. Does this mean we need to give everything that we have until we can no longer live to sustain ourselves or our family? <code>HOT</code></h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sometimes it may. We can name countless people in the Bible that gave all they had. The Apostle Paul talks about knowing how to be content in all circumstances <strong>Philippians 4:11-13 <em>ESV</em></strong> We know that in <strong>Acts 2:42-47 <em>ESV</em></strong> all the believers sold their possessions in order to give, that none would be poor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe4 came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord ladded to their number day by day those who were being saved. <strong>Acts 2:42-47 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see in those verses a perfect example of the balance that can be struck when we follow after God. They gave what they had, they sold their belongings, but no one had need because everyone had everything in common. By the way, this is not a plug for communism as a form of governmental system, but in the Church we should look after each other.</p>

<p>God will provide our needs. This does not mean that we should live foolishly and give our money or possessions to any random person we meet on the road, the believers in Acts were looking after other believers. We also see many Scriptures that tell us to be wise and store up what we need in times of plenty in order to have something when times are lean. We see this idea of saving. There are many wealthy people in the Scriptures, including Job or Lydia the dyer of purple cloth who provided a place for Christians to meet in the 1st century. There is nothing wrong with having the blessings that God has given us, but it does mean that when we know that Christ is asking for us to sacrifice for Him that we do it. Because that is how we love one another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <strong>James 2:15-16 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>

<p>29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?9 And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. <strong>Matthew 10:31 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>

<p>26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? <strong>Matthew 6:26 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>

<p>24 Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! <strong>Luke 12:24 <em>ESV</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="verse-19-24">Verse 19-24</h3>

<p>In the previous verses we saw how love and actions must be melded together in perfect harmony if we are to truly be a disciple of God. Love without action is ineffectual, and action without love (including correction), can be harmful.</p>

<p>In this lesson we are going to look at the topic of personal salvation and how to relates to our &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; of &ldquo;being saved&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Read 1 John 3:19-24</strong></p>

<h4 id="q1-what-does-the-word-heart-refer-to-here">Q1. What does the word &ldquo;heart&rdquo; refer to here?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The closest translation would be the word &ldquo;conscience&rdquo;. It is not the organ that pumps blood but the conscience that needs reassurance. It is the conscience that can feel unworthy or uncertain.</p>

<h4 id="q2-do-you-ever-feel-like-you-are-unworthy-of-god-s-love-and-forgiveness-hot">Q2. Do you ever feel like you are unworthy of God&rsquo;s love and forgiveness? <code>HOT</code></h4>

<p>We all struggle. We all have our own feelings of self-doubt and untruths about who we are. We also have genuine struggles with sin and when we falter, we feel guilt, which is appropriate. It is important though, that we don&rsquo;t linger on that guilt, but allow it to move us to repentance and a change in lifestyle.</p>

<h4 id="q3-do-you-ever-feel-confident-in-your-faith">Q3. Do you ever feel confident in your faith?</h4>
