        <p>Prayer is a powerful thing. Many times in the Scriptures we see Jesus going away by Himself to pray. We see the Apostles telling the churches that they write that they are praying for them. We see them also requesting prayer for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 John 5:16</strong></p>

<p>[16] If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. (ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Mark 11:23–25</strong></p>

<p>[23] Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. [24] Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. [25] And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” (ESV)</p>

<p><strong>James 5:16–18</strong></p>

<p>[16] Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. [17] Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. [18] Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1 John we see that our prayers on the behalf of others can give life from God. In Mark we see that prayers offered in belief can do great things (assuming that what you pray for lines up with God&rsquo;s will). In James we see that Elijah was a man like us and when he prayed fervently that it would not rain it didn&rsquo;t rain for three and a half years! Prayer is powerful.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why I mention prayer at communion time. It is because Jesus, while on the Earth, was a man of prayer. He many times would go away by Himself to pray. He even taught his disciples how to pray. Many of us, I am sure could quote &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo;. When we come to this time of communion though, I think of a specific prayer. I think of the prayer of Jesus right before he is arrested. I think about the drops of blood that he shed, so great was His distress. Jesus asks His father in heaven to please, not make him die on the cross. But we all know that Jesus did die on the cross. If that were me, I would wonder, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t God hear my prayer.&rdquo; He must not have heard, because He didn&rsquo;t deliver me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hebrews 5:7–8</strong></p>

<p>[7] In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. [8] Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words of Jesus immediately after praying that He wouldn&rsquo;t have to suffer and die on the cross were &ldquo;Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.&rdquo; That is from Luke 22. Jesus Christ was heard. And yet, it was the Lord&rsquo;s will to crush him that we would not bear the weight and the penalty for our sins. We come together at this time of communion to remember Jesus, who was heard in His prayers and who, knowing the answer to His prayer, came to the cross and died for us. Let us remember Him.</p>
