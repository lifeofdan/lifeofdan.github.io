      <description>Chapter 19 of John tells of Jesus in the hands of Pilate. Pilate was an interesting individual. He was a weak leader. According to the piece of historical evidence we have for him we see that he was the &amp;ldquo;prefect&amp;rdquo; of this area. Basically, he was a military man. He had soldiers, was responsible for collecting taxes, and had limited judicial authority. He was, ultimately, responsible to Rome but he was in Judea.</description>

      <description>Prayer is a powerful thing. Many times in the Scriptures we see Jesus going away by Himself to pray. We see the Apostles telling the churches that they write that they are praying for them. We see them also requesting prayer for themselves.
 1 John 5:16
[16] If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him lifeâ€”to those who commit sins that do not lead to death.</description>

      <description>Recently I have begun to listen to the Psalms as I am driving around. I find most of them to be comforting or encouraging. The language is so grand. For example:
Psalms 1:1-2 starts this book out&amp;hellip;
 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.</description>

      <description>Revelation is an interesting book. Just making that statement probably fills most of you with worry. You are thinking &amp;ldquo;Oh dear, what is he going to say. What thing is he going to talk about that probably makes no sense whatsoever.&amp;rdquo; None the less, it is an interesting book, that is filled with hope for those who believe.
The scripture I want to look at is:
Revelation 5:1-5 ESV &amp;gt; 5 Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</description>
