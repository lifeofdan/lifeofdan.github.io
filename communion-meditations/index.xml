      <description>Recently I have begun to listen to the Psalms as I am driving around. I find most of them to be comforting or encouraging. The language is so grand. For example:
Psalms 1:1-2 starts this book out&amp;hellip;
 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.</description>

      <description>Revelation is an interesting book. Just making that statement probably fills most of you with worry. You are thinking &amp;ldquo;Oh dear, what is he going to say. What thing is he going to talk about that probably makes no sense whatsoever.&amp;rdquo; None the less, it is an interesting book, that is filled with hope for those who believe.
The scripture I want to look at is:
Revelation 5:1-5 ESV &amp;gt; 5 Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</description>
